Mumbo Jumbo - A digital pictographic encryption tool by Nem Moonglove

This application has been developed on MacOS 10.12.6 using Python 3.6.2,
and the IDLE code editor.

Installed libraries:
 - Numpy
 - Pillow
 - Py2app

Overview - This application creates a twin-fold encryption on data for the
secure transfer of information over insecure platforms. First, a text-based
encryption algorithm runs to provide an initial layer of protection, and
then the encoded string is converted into coloured pixels and distributed
into an image. A private key can also be provided to prevent others with the
same program from decrypting your messages.

Table of Contents:

MumboJumbo.py - The main code file, is used to execute the program.
Inverter_of_Truth.py - A text based Encryption program imported by the main program.
setup.py - Generated by py2app, used for building the finished application.
Mumbo_Icon.icns - The application icon used for the finished application.
Image_Library - A list of test images for testing the program.
Info - A collection of plain text files used for an in-app tutorial
Input - An empty folder, used for the user input of image files
Output - Encryptd images appear here to be picked up by the user.
_pycache_ - Generated when another python program is imported.
