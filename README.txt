Mumbo Jumbo - A digital pictographic encryption tool by Nem Moonglove

This application has been developed on MacOS 10.12.6 using Python 3.6.2, and the IDLE code editor.

Overview - This application creates a twin-fold encryption on data for the secure transfer of information over insecure platforms. First, a text-based encryption algorithm runs to provide an initial layer of protection, and then the encoded string is converted into coloured pixels and distributed into an image. A private key can also be provided to prevent others with the same program from decrypting your messages.

For a full overview on using the program, see the Walkthrough via the help icon on the application, or access the text files in the Info folder.
