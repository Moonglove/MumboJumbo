Troubleshooting

Something not working? Follow this checklist below:

Encrypting:
1) Ensure the Input folder is empty before adding your
images to it.
2) Ensure the Output folder is empty before using the
Encrypt function.
3) Ensure that all images were created with the .png
file extension.


Decrypting:
1) Ensure the Input folder is empty before adding your
images to it.
2) If you did not use a key to encrypt, ensure the Key
Input field is left blank.
3) If you used a key, ensure that key has been entered
in the Key Input field prior to decryption.
4) Ensure that the names of all images end in #Number.
(ex. pomegranate#1.png)
5) Ensure that the total pixel area of your image(s) is
significantly larger than the message you are encrypting.
