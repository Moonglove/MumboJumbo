Mumbo Jumbo User Guide - by Lochlann Freitag

Overview:

Mumbo Jumbo is an encryption program that can hide secret
messages in images. These images can then be decrypted
by another computer running the same program. While a
message is encoded into an image, the image should appear
the same, provided that the image contains significantly
more pixels that the message contains characters. Otherwise,
the image may appear slightly pixelated.

This program excels at allowing people to communicate
covertly through the ordinary correspondence of vacation
photos, selfies, or other miscellaneous images.

program's functionality, as well as advanced features,
troubleshooting, and documentation.
