Key Input:

A key is like a password, an
extra layer of security to help
protect the messages that you encrypt.

While Mumbo Jumbo uses advanced
cryptographic techniques, other
people using Mumbo Jumbo can still
decrypt your images if you do not
use a key. By using a key, others
would need both the Mumbo Jumbo
application, and your personal key to
decrypt your message.

To use a key, type a passphrase or
message into the Key Input box below
your message before you press the
Encrypt button. When you need to
decrypt your image, retype your key
into the Key Input box before pressing
the Decrypt button.
