The Decrypt Function

To decrypt an image(s) created with Mumbo Jumbo, there
are three simple steps:

1) Add the image(s) you want to decrypt to the Input folder,
accessible by clicking the "Open Input" button in the
bottom right corner of the screen. Ensure that the image(s)
you want to decrypt are the only image(s) in the folder.

2) Optional: If your image(s) have been encrypted with a key,
type that key into the Key Input box before continuing. If
not, leave this field blank.

3) Press the Decrypt button, above the main text box. The
system will inform you of the estimated processing time,
which scales based on the size of your image(s). After
that time has elapsed, your decrypted message will be
displayed in the main text box.

If your image was not successfully decrypted, see
the troubleshooting guide at the end of this tutorial.
