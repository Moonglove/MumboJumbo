The Encrypt Function

To encrypt a message into an image(s), there are
four simple steps:

1) Add one or more .png images to the Input folder. This
can be opened by clicking the "Open Input" button in the
bottom right corner of the screen. You can use the default
image(s) in the Image Library folder, or add your own.

2) Type your message into the large text box in the
centre of the screen. You can use all characters
and symbols included on a standard keyboard. Emojis
and irregular characters will be automatically removed.

3) Optional: Type a key, as long or as short as you
like, into the Key Input box. If used, this key will be
required when the image(s) is to be decrypted.

4) Press the Encrypt button above the text box. The system
will inform you of the estimated processing time, which scales
based on the size of your image(s). After that time has elapsed,
the output folder will automatically open, and you can find your
new image(s) there, with your message encrypted inside. If
multiple images are used, the message will be distributed among
all of them, and all images will need to be present for decryption.
